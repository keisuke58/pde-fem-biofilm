# Hand-off to Felix — biofilm material model → ANSYS FEM

Goal: replace the phenomenological constitutive model in Felix/IKM's existing
ANSYS FE model with the paper's calibrated biofilm growth / viscoelastic law,
called at each Gauss point (eventually via a Python material model). This sheet
lists **what to hand over, in what order, and what is needed back** to run it.

Status of the deliverable: the ANSYS `USERMAT` is **syntax-checked (gfortran) and
numerically verified against a Python replica**, but **not yet run inside ANSYS**.
Treat it as a validated starting point, not a drop-in black box.

## ① Core — hand over first (self-contained, compiles today)

- [ ] **`ansys_usermat/usermat_biofilm.f`** — the ANSYS `USERMAT`. Felix swaps his
      phenomenological law for this. Growth `Fg=(1+α)I` + Neo-Hookean/`D1` +
      backward-Euler viscoelasticity + F-perturbation consistent tangent.
- [ ] **`ansys_usermat/README.md`** — read first: Abaqus↔ANSYS mapping table,
      `prop`/`ustatev` layout, `TB,USER`/`TB,STATE` setup, build & syntax-check.

Minimum viable hand-off = ① only. With it Felix can compile and drop the law
into a single-element ANSYS model.

## ② Evidence — so the law is trusted

- [ ] **`umat_biofilm_visco.f`**, **`umat_biofilm_visco_phase2.f`** — the verified
      Abaqus UMATs the port mirrors (the reference implementation).
- [ ] **`phase2_patch_test.py`** — Python replica; patch tests 13/13, tangent
      vs FD ~2.4e-8. (The ANSYS port reproduces the same algebra → 2.97e-8.)
- [ ] **`VERIFICATION_SENSITIVITY_LIMITATIONS.md`** — what is verified vs assumed.
- [ ] *(optional)* `umat_flow/` — UMAT algorithm-flow figures.

## ③ Coupling plan — the Python-at-Gauss-point step (the thesis work)

- [ ] **`ch5_flow/flow_impl_architecture.png`** — Python(JAX) ↔ ISO_C_BINDING /
      socket ↔ USERMAT ↔ ANSYS Gauss-point loop.
- [ ] **`ch5_flow/flow_growth_kinematics.png`** — `F=Fe·Fg` kinematics (the model's basis).
- [ ] **`material_models.py`**, **`JAXFEM/`** — the Python material model that the
      `PYTHON MATERIAL HOOK` in the USERMAT will call.

## Needed back from Felix (blocks an actual ANSYS run)

1. [ ] **Target ANSYS version + exact `usermat` argument list** (`var1..var8`,
       `tsstif`, `epsZZ`, `cutFactor` vary by release), and whether **`dsdePl`**
       is expected as the Jaumann material Jacobian (may need rotation `rotateM`
       / symmetrisation).
2. [ ] **Material parameters** `C10, C01, D1, eta` (units: stress / 1-stress /
       stress·time) — and the **growth `α` field**: how the JAXFEM α-field is
       delivered to each integration point (`TB,STATE` init vs user field).
3. [ ] **A single-element smoke test** in ANSYS (uniaxial / simple shear) to
       confirm interface wiring before touching the full model.

## Suggested sequence

1. Hand over ①; Felix confirms the `usermat` signature for his ANSYS version.
2. Single-element smoke test → compare stress/tangent against the Abaqus UMAT
   (same F, same params) — should match to machine precision.
3. Plug into the full model with the α-field (item 2 above), phenomenological
   law removed.
4. Wire the `PYTHON MATERIAL HOOK` (③) — the thesis' core contribution; keep the
   inline Fortran core as the verification reference / fallback.

*One-line framing for Felix:* "A USERMAT that implements our verified biofilm
growth/viscoelastic law (matches the Abaqus UMAT to machine precision) with an
explicit hook to later call the Python material model per Gauss point — needs a
version/interface check and a single-element smoke test before going into the
full model."
